RDR1 Demonic Revelations Mod Menu Source Code.
PS3 Untested source now added.

PS: Don't take the menu and just up and rename it and act like you cracked the menu lol. The menu is open source for a reason, but all I ask is that you leave the menu credits in the menu. Renaming the menu and removing credits makes you a skid. You aren't special by doing that.

Updated ps3 source a bit and added releases with loose files required for demonic to work as it should as well as pre-modded files for those who are lazy.  
ALSO  
Since some people seem confused. I'll make it more clear now.
IF you use the source and edit it and release a edited version, show the menu or the edited version on youtube, any site, any video hoster site, any file hoster site etc

In the description, post, etc. You must include credits to everybody who originally helped on the menu
You need to also link to the original menu source code aka this github link, to show people which menu source you used.


Do whatever you wish with the source just be sure to give credits to the below. [This includes keeping menu credits, and adding these credits to the thread/description of wherever you release the edit to]

Just copy and paste the below in your release, and add your own credit for noteworthy edits/changes
